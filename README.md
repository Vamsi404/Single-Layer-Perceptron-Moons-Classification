# Single-Layer-Perceptron-Moons-Classification
This repository implements a single-layer perceptron using Python to classify data generated from make_moons. The model uses logistic regression for binary classification, trained with gradient descent. It includes visualization of decision boundaries and computes training accuracy to evaluate performance.
